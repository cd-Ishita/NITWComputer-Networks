Code follows the flowcharts made in the answer sheets

P opens FIFO1 and FIFO2 and sends data to FIFO1, at the end of data it send \d to FIFO1
S also opens FIFO1 and FIFO2 as well as a Unix Domain Socket connection with A (this initialisation is where the problems with Unix Domain Sockets begins, after this all fds misbehave)
S receives data from FIFO1 and prints until it gets \d 
S then signals A to start scoring 
A receives the FIFO2 fd 
A has threads for judges that start scoring and send the data on FIFO2
 

Unfortunately the Unix Domain Socket code does not work, because of which the fd is not getting sent and the data isnt received.
