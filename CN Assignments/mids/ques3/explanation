Code follows the flowcharts made in the answer sheets

AT opens unix domain sockets and connects with r1 r2 r3 round files
AT also opens sfd that clients that connect to directly
Whenever AT receives client, create a thread and redirect to thread function which sends fd to rounds in order to get scoring
Rounds receive clients and score them and then send the score to Jury on a message queue with message type as client id
Jury receives the scores and stores it
On reaching max clients, it sends signal to AT to stop

Unfortunately the Unix Domain Socket code does not work, because of which the fd is not getting sent and the data isnt received.
